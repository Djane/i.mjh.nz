    <title>Night of the Living Dead</title>
    <desc>A disparate group of individuals takes refuge in an abandoned house when corpses begin to leave the graveyard in search of fresh human bodies to devour. The pragmatic Ben (Duane Jones) does his best to control the situation, but when the reanimated bodies surround the house, the other survivors begin to panic. As any semblance of order within the group begins to dissipate, the zombies start to find ways inside -- and one by one, the living humans become the prey of the deceased ones.</desc>

    <desc>Ben Cartwright is the patriarch of an all-male Nevada ranching family. Set during and after the Civil War, "Bonanza" is the story of life on the family's thousand-acre spread, known as the Ponderosa, near Virginia City. Ben has his three sons, each with a different (and deceased) mother. Serious eldest son Adam hopes to follow in his father's footsteps; middle son Hoss is a gentle giant -- physically strong, but sometimes naive; and youngest son Little Joe is the most impetuous and romantic of the offspring.</desc>

    <title>The Librarians</title>
    <desc>Cued by the popular "The Librarian" trilogy, this series introduces new members of an ancient group protecting mystical artifacts. Hidden below the Metropolitan Public Library, the secret society's longtime leader is Flynn Carsen, whose job has become very complicated. To help, the Library recruits Eve, a counterterrorism agent responsible for organizational security; Jacob, who has encyclopedic knowledge of art, architecture and history; Cassandra, who links auditory/sensory hallucinations to memory; and Ezekiel, a skilled thief and master technician. Overseeing them is Jenkins, the reclusive caretaker of the Library's sleepy little annex in Oregon. Noah Wyle executive produces and recurs as Flynn, the role he played in the movie series.</desc>

Growing up in a musical family, her mom who is also a singer, would put earbuds on her stomach so Piao could listen in. After moving to Canada, Piao was accepted into the prestigious Young Artist Performance Academy of The Royal Conservatory of Music, where she studied classical piano performance. In the space of 4 years, she received first place standings in seven provincial competitions under the ARCT Conservatory division. She then went on to attend and graduated from the Berklee College of Music with a full presidential scholarship.

    <title>Moving Stories</title>
    <desc>A film, by Rob Fruchtman, Cornelia Ravenal, Mikael Sdersten, Wendy Sax Six, about diverse dancers from the acclaimed Battery Dance Company who travel the world, working with youth who have experienced war, poverty, prejudice, sexual exploitation, and severe trauma as refugees. In India they work with girls rescued from sex trafficking and gender violence; in Romania, with gypsy kids from one of Europe's worst slums; in South Korea, with young North Koreans who risked their lives to escape; and in Iraq, with a gifted young Muslim dancer, fighting to survive. Incredibly, they have just one week to teach the tools of choreography and collaboration to kids who may be enemies, who may have been abused, who may be suspicious and fearful, so that they can create dances to perform for their communities. As they struggle to break through, the dancer-teachers confront their own frustrations. Yet their students respond in extraordinary ways - and as they prepare to perform in public in what seems an impossibly short time, both students and teachers experience surprising transformations, unlocking feelings and stories in wellsprings of creativity.</desc>

    <title>The Dead Mothers Club</title>
    <desc>The (Dead Mothers) Club tells the story of three women- a Southern artist redefining herself through her art; a high school senior struggling to gain independence; and a Brazilian living in NY, navigating first-time motherhood  all of whom lost their mothers during adolescence. The film reveals how coming of age without their mothers has and continues to play a role in their lives. Structured around a series of dialogues featuring Rosie ODonnell, Molly Shannon and Jane Fonda that focus on various themes threading their stories together, these ruminations allow for heart-breaking and at times humorous insight into how ultimately ones past can dictate their future. From the cyclical nature of grief to their own mortality, the women of The Club provoke thoughts surrounding the innate, complicated nature of the mother/daughter relationship, even in its absence.</desc>

    <title>Kumu Hina</title>
    <desc>Imagine a world where a little boy can grow up to be the woman of his dreams, and a young girl can rise to become a leader among men. Welcome to Kumu Hina's Hawai'i. Kumu Hina tells the inspiring story of Hina Wong-Kalu, a transgender native Hawaiian teacher, or kumu, who brings to life Hawaii's traditional embrace of mahu - those who embody both male and female spirit. Produced by Emmy-winning directors Dean Hamer and Joe Wilson in association with ITVS and Pacifc Islanders in Communications, the film traces Hina's evolution from Collin Wong, a timid high school boy, to her present position as a married woman and cultural director of a school in one of Honolulu's grittier neighborhoods. When Hoonani, a charismatic 6th grade girl, asks to join the school's all-male hula troupe, Kumu Hina gives her the opportunity to express her inner male spirit. As teacher and student prepare for a climactic end-of-year public performance, they meet many obstacles, but hold fast to the idea that being true to oneself matters most.</desc>
