    <title>Card Sharks</title>
    <desc>This show from legendary Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions features two contestants trying to predict answers to survey questions for the opportunity to play a game with oversized playing cards for a chance to win cash. One contestant guesses how many people (out of 100) gave a certain answer to a question and the other contestant then guesses if the number is higher or lower than the opponent's guess. The winning contestant then faces a row of cards and must determine if each succeeding card is higher or lower than the one that precedes it. The contestant who wins two out of three games wins the match and plays the bonus round, called Money Cards. The Money Cards round is similar to the card game in the main game but with three levels of cards instead of one row. The contestant is given $200 at the beginning of Money Cards and wagers any or all of that money when guessing if the cards will be higher or lower than the previous one. A perfect round could earn the contestant $28,800.</desc>

    <desc>When an undersea volcano sends tremors throughout the Atlantic, aquatic creatures come out of hiding. Merchant seamen Joe Ryan (Bill Travers) and partner Sam Slade (William Sylvester) harness the most unusual of the lot, a massive beast that looks like a Tyrannosaurus Rex. The enterprising sailors deliver their quarry to a British circus, but it turns out that the animal is a newborn. And, when his much larger mother arrives in London to rescue her son, the city feels her wrath.</desc>

    <title>Moving Stories</title>
    <desc>A film, by Rob Fruchtman, Cornelia Ravenal, Mikael Sdersten, Wendy Sax Six, about diverse dancers from the acclaimed Battery Dance Company who travel the world, working with youth who have experienced war, poverty, prejudice, sexual exploitation, and severe trauma as refugees. In India they work with girls rescued from sex trafficking and gender violence; in Romania, with gypsy kids from one of Europe's worst slums; in South Korea, with young North Koreans who risked their lives to escape; and in Iraq, with a gifted young Muslim dancer, fighting to survive. Incredibly, they have just one week to teach the tools of choreography and collaboration to kids who may be enemies, who may have been abused, who may be suspicious and fearful, so that they can create dances to perform for their communities. As they struggle to break through, the dancer-teachers confront their own frustrations. Yet their students respond in extraordinary ways - and as they prepare to perform in public in what seems an impossibly short time, both students and teachers experience surprising transformations, unlocking feelings and stories in wellsprings of creativity.</desc>

    <title>The Dead Mothers Club</title>
    <desc>The (Dead Mothers) Club tells the story of three women- a Southern artist redefining herself through her art; a high school senior struggling to gain independence; and a Brazilian living in NY, navigating first-time motherhood  all of whom lost their mothers during adolescence. The film reveals how coming of age without their mothers has and continues to play a role in their lives. Structured around a series of dialogues featuring Rosie ODonnell, Molly Shannon and Jane Fonda that focus on various themes threading their stories together, these ruminations allow for heart-breaking and at times humorous insight into how ultimately ones past can dictate their future. From the cyclical nature of grief to their own mortality, the women of The Club provoke thoughts surrounding the innate, complicated nature of the mother/daughter relationship, even in its absence.</desc>

    <title>Kumu Hina</title>
    <desc>Imagine a world where a little boy can grow up to be the woman of his dreams, and a young girl can rise to become a leader among men. Welcome to Kumu Hina's Hawai'i. Kumu Hina tells the inspiring story of Hina Wong-Kalu, a transgender native Hawaiian teacher, or kumu, who brings to life Hawaii's traditional embrace of mahu - those who embody both male and female spirit. Produced by Emmy-winning directors Dean Hamer and Joe Wilson in association with ITVS and Pacifc Islanders in Communications, the film traces Hina's evolution from Collin Wong, a timid high school boy, to her present position as a married woman and cultural director of a school in one of Honolulu's grittier neighborhoods. When Hoonani, a charismatic 6th grade girl, asks to join the school's all-male hula troupe, Kumu Hina gives her the opportunity to express her inner male spirit. As teacher and student prepare for a climactic end-of-year public performance, they meet many obstacles, but hold fast to the idea that being true to oneself matters most.</desc>
