    <title>Card Sharks</title>
    <desc>This show from legendary Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions features two contestants trying to predict answers to survey questions for the opportunity to play a game with oversized playing cards for a chance to win cash. One contestant guesses how many people (out of 100) gave a certain answer to a question and the other contestant then guesses if the number is higher or lower than the opponent's guess. The winning contestant then faces a row of cards and must determine if each succeeding card is higher or lower than the one that precedes it. The contestant who wins two out of three games wins the match and plays the bonus round, called Money Cards. The Money Cards round is similar to the card game in the main game but with three levels of cards instead of one row. The contestant is given $200 at the beginning of Money Cards and wagers any or all of that money when guessing if the cards will be higher or lower than the previous one. A perfect round could earn the contestant $28,800.</desc>

    <desc>Cued by the popular "The Librarian" trilogy, this series introduces new members of an ancient group protecting mystical artifacts. Hidden below the Metropolitan Public Library, the secret society's longtime leader is Flynn Carsen, whose job has become very complicated. To help, the Library recruits Eve, a counterterrorism agent responsible for organizational security; Jacob, who has encyclopedic knowledge of art, architecture and history; Cassandra, who links auditory/sensory hallucinations to memory; and Ezekiel, a skilled thief and master technician. Overseeing them is Jenkins, the reclusive caretaker of the Library's sleepy little annex in Oregon. Noah Wyle executive produces and recurs as Flynn, the role he played in the movie series.</desc>

    <title>Uncut with Jay Cutler</title>
    <desc>Jay sits down with former teammate and friend Josh McCown, a journeyman quarterback who played alongside Jay in Chicago. Jay dives into Josh's coaching on the high school level, and what he carries into his HS job from his years in NFL systems. And of course with two seasoned quarterbacks, they get into today's QB play in the NFL, and how spread offenses are an accepted standard in today's game, and guys like Lamar Jackson need to adapt to becoming a pocket passer to extend his career. And as Josh's son goes through recruitment he jokes about how wildly different it is from when he and Jay were recruited. Plus both Jay and Josh get into how they've tried to approach football with their kids, and when is the right time to get them into pads and tackle. And it wouldn't be complete without Jay and Josh joking about their ping pong battles in Chicago, and how they approached their games as they got later in their careers. Make sure to follow Jay on Twitter (@JayHasTweets) and on Instagram (@ifjayhadinstagram) for the latest on the show!</desc>

    <desc>The 2018 SXSW Audience Award-winning feature film debut by Gabriel Silverman, Fiona Dawson, &amp;amp;amp; Jamie Coughlin, TransMilitary follows the Emmy-nominated short film Transgender, at War and in Love. Around 15,500 transgender people serve in the U.S. military (notably the largest transgender employer in the U.S.), where they must conceal their gender identity because military policies ban their service. TransMilitary chronicles the lives of four individuals (Senior Airman Logan Ireland, Corporal Laila Villanueva, Captain Jennifer Peace &amp;amp;amp; First Lieutenant El Cook) defending their countrys freedom while fighting for their own. They put their careers and their families livelihoods on the line by coming out as transgender to top brass officials in the Pentagon in hopes of attaining the equal right to serve. The ban was lifted in 2016, but with President Trump now trying to reinstate it, their futures hang in the balance once again.</desc>

    <title>The Most Dangerous Year</title>
    <desc>As a dark wave of anti-transgender bathroom bills began sweeping across the nation, The Human Rights Campaign called 2016 the most dangerous year ever for transgender Americans. Filmmaker Vlada Knowlton captured the ensuing civil rights battle from the perspective of a group of embattled parents  including herself and her husband, parents of a young trans girl -- fighting to protect their children from discriminatory laws in their home state. While Knowlton passionately follows the story of anti-transgender legislation, the heart of the film lies in the stories of the families who accept and support their kids for exactly who they are.</desc>
